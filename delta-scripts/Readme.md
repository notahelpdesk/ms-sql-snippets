# SQL Snippets - delta-scripts

This folder has scripts to simplify the creation of delta scripts for creating and updating databases.
There are snippet files for the following editors

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) 
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx). Note that snippets were not introduced into SSMS until the 2012 version (version 11.0)
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

The following snippets are available:

| Name | Description | Shortcut |

| Add Column Constraint | If a constraint does not exists on the specified column does not exist in the table, add it | addcolumnconstraint |
| Create Schema | If the specified schema does not exist, it will be created | createschema |
| Create Stored Procedure | Create the specified stored procedure | createstoredproc |
| Create Table | If the specified table does not exist in the database, create it | createtable |
| Create View | If the specified view does not exist in the table, create it. If it does exist, drop it and recreate it | createview |

| Make Column Non-Null | Make an existing column non-null. Note that you need to know the existing definition of the column | makenonnull |

## delta-scripts: General notes

The scripts take advantage of the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema common to SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL, however the implementations use logic which does not necessarily work across databases.
