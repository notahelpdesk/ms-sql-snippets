# SQL Delta Scripts for Notepad++

## Installation

These snippets are designed for use with the fantastic [FingerText](https://github.com/erinata/FingerText) plugin. 

* If you do not have FingerText already installed, this can be installed easily using the Plugin Manager within Notepad++. 
* Once the plugin has been installed, simply select "Plugins" -> "FingerText" -> "Import snippets from ftd file" from the menu and specify the file ````sql_snippets.ftd```` from this folder.

From this point on, simply set the document language to be SQL and type the name of the snippet you wish to use (e.g. 'createtable-ms') and press tab to insert the code. Placeholders are present to reduce the amount of typing required.

## Notes

* For these snippets to appear, your document must be set to the language "SQL"
* To support other RDBMS systems, the snippets have all been suffixed with "-ms" to indicate they are designed for MS SQL Server
